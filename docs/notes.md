## 5.1
- People create computing innovations
- The way people complete tasks often changes to incorporate new computing innovations
- Not every effect of a computing innovation is anticipated in advance
- A single effect can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different people or even a single person
Advances in computing have generated and increased creativity in other fields, such as medicine, engineering, communications, and the arts
Beneficial and Harmful Effects
(Quadcopter, Wii)
- Benefit: Deliveries, finding lost people, aerial photography
- Harm: Flying in unregulated zones, privacy concerns
- Benefit: Gets people active
- Harm: Broken TV and injuries
- 3D Printer Benefits: Open source software for computer and printer, in schools and homes, and special 3D printers can make several things; example of computing innovations and increased creativity
- Practice Question: B, Correct, because you presume it will work as intended unless stated otherwise
- The Internet: It was originally for scientists, but it has become more mainstream
- Harms: Very reliant on WWW, dopamine feedback loops, sleep deprivation, depression, anxiety, impulsivity
- Microtransactions: Example of how some computing innovations can have a harmful impact on society, the economy, or culture

## 5.2
- Internet access varies between socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic characteristics, as well as between countries
- The digital divide refers to differing access to computing devices and the Internet, based on socioeconomic, graphic, or demographic characteristics
- The digital divide can affect both groups and individuals
- The digital divide raises issues of equity, access, and influence, both globally and locally
- The digital divide is affected by the actions of individuals, organizations, and governments
- Computers are not that common in rural areas, only a small number of websites could be available, the  Internet is used to protect and advocate the government, and there is a high level of surveillance on the internet to protect the government
- Practice Question 1: C, Correct, because providing computers can provide equity

## 5.3
- Computing innovations can reflect existing human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation
- Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases
- Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development


- Explicit data for Netflix::
  - Thumbs
  - Name, address
  - Implicit Data:
  - When you watch
  - What you binged
  - Style of show frequently selected
  - Bias
  - Subscriptions

- Loan Companies
  - Creating software to assist loan officers
  - Find trends in successful loans
  - Reject those who don't fit trends for age, gender, or race/ethnicity 

- All software can be biased towards a demographic

- Questions to ask about bias:
  - Enhancing or intentionally excluding?
  - Intentionally harmful or hateful?
  - Receiving feedback from a wide variety of people?

## 5.4
- Public Data Sets: Examples include Kaggle, Google Public Datasets, Data.gov, and local government data sets
- Distributed Computing
  - Study of computer systems that communicate amongst each other
  - Examples: Folding@Home (Stanford) and BOINC (UCB)
  - Science has been affected using distributed and citizen science
  - Citizen science is research conducted by distributed individuals
  - Human capabilities can be enhanced via computing
  - Crowdsourcing  is where individuals or organizations obtain goods and services
  - EX: Spotify, Crowdfunding, Blockchain

## 5.5
- Intellectual Property is a work or invention that is the result of creativity to which one has rights

- Copyright
   - Protects IP and keeps anyone from using it
   - Plagiarism: Presenting someone else’s IP as your own
   - Legal ways to use material created by someone else:
   - Creative Commons provides free licenses that you can use to tell others how you want them to use your creations
   - Open Source/OpenAccess are programs made freely available for anyone to use and may be redistributed and modified
   - Legal and Ethical Concerns are mainly taking someone else’s intellectual property

## 5.6
- Personally Identifiable Information
  - Personally Identifiable Information; Information Specific to an individual
  - Can be used by people to steal someone else’s identity
  - Search engines maintain a history of what you search
  - Suggests to other websites what you may like (targeted marketing)
  - PII can enhance a user’s online experience but can be exploited of privacy protections are ignored

- Risks to Privacy
  - The federal government learns where and when you are traveling
  - Google, Facebook, and Twitter can gather information about your behavior
  - You have little control over who sees this behavior and this information is difficult to delete
  - Information posted to social media can be used by others to deduce private information → used in ways that were not intended and have a harmful impact

- Authentication 
   - Measures protect devices and information from unauthorized access
   - Authentication measures: Strong Passwords and Multi-factor authentication

- Virus and Malware
   - Virus: malicious programs that can copy themselves and gain access to systems that they are not supposed to be allowed in
   - Malware: Intended to damage a computing system or control its operation
   - Virus scans can prevent malware or malicious code
   - Once legitimate access to a system is gained, it is important to ensure data sent to and from the system is uncompromised
   - Encryption: Encoding of data to prevent unauthorized access
   - Symmetric Encryption and Asymmetric encryption
   - Asymmetric Encryption: 
   - Public Key Encryption: One public key for encrypting and a private one for decrypting
   - Decryption: Process of decoding data

- Importance of the Internet: nInternet is very important

- Risks to Personal Safety
- Phishing: An attempt to trick a user into providing personal information and take the form of a trustful company
- Can install a virus or install a keylogger
- Keyloggers can record keystrokes made by a user to gain access to passwords
- Rogue Access Point: A wireless network that can give unauthorized access to secure networks
